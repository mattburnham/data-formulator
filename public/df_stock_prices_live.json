The json object should have the following format:\n\n{\n    \"mode\": \"\" // string, one of \"infer\", \"overview\", \"distribution\", \"summary\", \"forecast\"\n    \"recap\": \"...\" // string, a short summary of the user's goal.\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the even shorter verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"recommendation\": \"...\" // string, explain why this recommendation is made\n    \"input_tables\": [...] // string[], describe names of the input tables that will be used in the transformation.\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have (i.e., the goal of transformed data), it's a good idea to preseve intermediate fields here\n    \"chart_type\": \"\" // string, one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\", 'boxplot'. \"chart_type\" should either be inferred from user instruction, or recommend if the user didn't specify any.\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of output fields, appropriate visual channels for different chart types are defined below.\n}\n\nConcretely:\n    - recap what the user's goal is in a short summary in \"recap\".\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is clear already, simply infer what the user mean. Set \"mode\" as \"infer\" and create \"output_fields\" and \"chart_encodings\" based off user description.\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is not clear, make recommendations to the user:\n        - choose one of \"distribution\", \"overview\", \"summary\", \"forecast\" in \"mode\":\n            * if it is \"overview\" and the data is in wide format, reshape it into long format.\n            * if it is \"distribution\", select a few fields that would be interesting to visualize together.\n            * if it is \"summary\", calculate some aggregated statistics to show intresting facts of the data.\n            * if it is \"forecast\", concretize the x,y fields that will be used for forecasting and decide if it is about regression or forecasting.\n        - describe the recommendation reason in \"recommendation\"\n        - based on the recommendation, determine what is an ideal output data. Note, the output data must be in tidy format.\n        - then suggest recommendations of chart encoding that should be used to create the visualization.\n    - \"display_instruction\" should be a short verb phrase describing the users' goal, it should be even shorter than \"recap\". \n        - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n        - generate based on \"recap\" and the suggested visualization, but don't need to mention the visualization details.\n        - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n        - if the user instruction builds up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n        - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n        - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n            * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n            * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n    - determine \"input_tables\", the names of a subset of input tables from [CONTEXT] section that will be used to achieve the user's goal.\n        - **IMPORTANT** Note that the Table 1 in [CONTEXT] section is the table the user is currently viewing, it should take precedence if the user refers to insights about the \"current table\".\n        - At the same time, leverage table information to determine which tables are relevant to the user's goal and should be used.\n    - \"chart_type\" must be one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\", \"boxplot\"\n    - \"chart_encodings\" should specify which fields should be used to create the visualization\n        - decide which visual channels should be used to create the visualization appropriate for the chart type.\n            - point: x, y, color, size, facet\n            - histogram: x, color, facet\n            - bar: x, y, color, facet\n            - line: x, y, color, facet\n            - area: x, y, color, facet\n            - heatmap: x, y, color, facet\n            - group_bar: x, y, color, facet\n            - boxplot: x, y, color, facet\n        - note that all fields used in \"chart_encodings\" should be included in \"output_fields\".\n            - all fields you need for visualizations should be transformed into the output fields!\n            - \"output_fields\" should include important intermediate fields that are not used in visualization but are used for data transformation.\n        - typically only 2-3 fields should be used to create the visualization (x, y, color/size), facet use be added if it's a faceted visualization (totally 4 fields used).\n    - Guidelines for choosing chart type and visualization fields:\n        - Consider chart types as follows:\n            - (point) Scatter Plots: x,y: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional), size: Quantitative (optional for creating bubble chart), \n                - best for: Relationships, correlations, distributions, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - scatter plots are good default way to visualize data when other chart types are not applicable.\n                - use color to visualize points from different categories.\n                - use size to visualize data points with an additional quantitative dimension of the data points.\n            - (histogram) Histograms: x: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped histogram), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the histogram will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n            - (bar) Bar Charts: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical/Quantitative (for stacked bar chart / showing additional quantitative dimension), \n                - best for: Comparisons across categories\n                - use (bar) for simple bar chart or stacked bar chart (when it makes sense to add up Y values for each category with the same X value), \n                    - when color is specified, the bar will be stacked automatically (items with the same x values will be stacked).\n                    - note that when there are multiple rows in the data with same x values, the bar will be stacked automatically.\n                        - 1. consider to use an aggregated field for y values if the value is not suitable for stacking.\n                        - 2. consider to introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate bar.\n            - (group_bar) for grouped bar chart, x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical\n                - when color is specifed, bars from different groups will be grouped automatically.\n                - only use facet if the cardinality of color field is small (less than 5).\n            - (line) Line Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating multiple lines), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - note that when there are multiple rows in the data belong to the same group (same x and color values) but different y values, the line will not look correct.\n                - consider to use an aggregated field for y values, or introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate line.\n            - (area) Area Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating stacked areas), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data\n            - (heatmap) Heatmaps: x,y: Categorical (you need to convert quantitative to nominal), color: Quantitative intensity, \n                - best for: Pattern discovery in matrix data\n            - (boxplot) Box plots: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped boxplots), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the boxplot will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n        - facet channel is available for all chart types, it supports a categorical field with small cardinality to visualize the data in different facets.\n        - if you really need additional legend fields:\n            - you can use opacity for legend (support Quantitative and Categorical).\n    - visualization fields require tidy data. \n        - similar to VegaLite and ggplot2 so that each field is mapped to a visualization axis or legend. \n        - consider data transformations if you want to visualize multiple fields together:\n            - exapmle 1: suggest reshaping the data into long format in data transformation description (if these fields are all of the same type, e.g., they are all about sales, price, two columns about min/max-values, etc. don't mix different types of fields in reshaping) so we can visualize multiple fields as categories or in different facets.\n            - exapmle 2: calculate some derived fields from these fields(e.g., correlation, difference, profit etc.) in data transformation description to visualize them in one visualization.\n            - example 3: create a visualization only with a subset of the fields, you don't have to visualize all of them in one chart, you can later create a visualization with the rest of the fields. With the subset of charts, you can also consider reshaping or calculate some derived value.\n            - again, it does not make sense to have five fields like [item, A, B, C, D, E] in visualization fields, you should consider data transformation to reduce the number of fields.\n            - when reshaping data to long format, only fields of the same semantic type should be rehaped into the same column.\n    - guide on statistical analysis:\n        - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n            - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n            - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n                - put is_predicted field in 'opacity' channel to distinguish them.\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            \n    2. Then, write a python function based on the inferred goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \n\"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined user intent in the json object.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE]. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable. \nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\n# from sklearn import ... # import from sklearn if you need it.\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- decide the function signature based on the number of tables you decided in the previous step \"input_tables\":\n    - if you decide there will only be one input table, then function signature should be `def transform_data(df1)`\n    - if you decided there will be k input tables, then function signature should be `def transform_data(df_1, df_2, ..., df_k)`.\n    - instead of using generic names like df1, df2, ..., try to use intuitive table names for function arguments, for example, if you have input_tables: [\"City\", \"Weather\"]`, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes.\n    - **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function signature must be the same as the number of tables provided in \"input_tables\", and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided in \"input_tables\".\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n    \n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing inferred user intent and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"[CONTEXT]\n\n## Table 1: history (738 rows × 8 columns)\n\n### Schema (8 fields)\n  - symbol -- type: object, values: AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, MSFT, NVDA\n  - date -- type: object, values: 2025-07-30, 2025-07-31, 2025-08-01, ..., 2026-01-20, 2026-01-21, 2026-01-22, 2026-01-23\n  - open -- type: float64, values: 167.53, 168.01, 169.07, ..., 781.21, 782.98, 785.25, 789.97\n  - high -- type: float64, values: 169.01, 170.94, 170.96, ..., 789.62, 792.49, 794.28, 795.06\n  - low -- type: float64, values: 164.05, 166.72, 167.2, ..., 771.36, 772.21, 777.07, 779.66\n  - close -- type: float64, values: 167.0, 168.29, 170.28, ..., 779.09, 780.97, 784.06, 788.82\n  - volume -- type: int64, values: 5627500, 5855900, 6861200, ..., 320600300, 324925900, 343504800, 346926200\n  - fetched_at -- type: object, values: 2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n\n### Sample Data (first 5 rows)\n```\n  symbol        date    open    high     low   close     volume                   fetched_at\n0   AAPL  2025-07-30  211.45  211.94  207.28  208.61   45512500  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n1   AAPL  2025-07-31  208.05  209.40  206.72  207.13   80698400  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n2   AAPL  2025-08-01  210.43  213.13  201.08  201.95  104434500  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n3   AAPL  2025-08-04  204.08  207.44  201.26  202.92   75109300  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n4   AAPL  2025-08-05  202.97  204.91  201.74  202.49   44155100  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n```\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\n1) First, plot the overall **closing price** trends for each **symbol** over **time** on a single line chart to compare their broad trajectories and volatility."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\n  \"mode\": \"infer\",\n  \"recap\": \"Compare overall closing price trends and volatility over time for each stock symbol on a single line chart.\",\n  \"display_instruction\": \"Visualize **closing price** trends by **symbol** over **date**\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"A line chart with time on the x-axis and closing price on the y-axis, colored by symbol, best shows comparative trajectories and volatility over time.

The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation.

EXPLANATION]\n\n- **Keep only the key fields**: selects the columns **`\"date\"`**, **`\"symbol\"`**, and **`\"close\"`** from the input data and **drops all other columns**.\n- **Standardize the date format**: converts **`date`** into a **string** in the **`\"YYYY-MM-DD\"`** format to ensure consistency (no time component, no different date formats).\n- **Order the data for time-series use**: **sorts** the rows first by **`symbol`** and then by **`date`** so that each stock’s closing prices are in **chronological order**, which is important for **line charts** or time-based analysis.\n- **Return the cleaned dataset**: outputs this **simplified and ordered** table as the final transformed data.\n\n[CONCEPTS

data that will be used for visualization.\nThe user will provide you information about what visualization they would like to create, and your job is to recommend a transformed data that can be used to create the visualization and write a python function to transform the data.\nThe recommendation and transformation function should be based on the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] provided by the user. \nThe [CONTEXT] shows what the current dataset is, and the [GOAL] describes what the user wants the data for.\n\n**Important:**\n- NEVER make assumptions or judgments about a person's gender, biological sex, sexuality, religion, race, nationality, ethnicity, political stance, socioeconomic status, mental health, invisible disabilities, medical conditions, personality type, social impressions, emotional state, and cognitive state.\n- NEVER create formulas that could be used to discriminate based on age. Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should infer the appropriate data and create in the output section a python function based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] in two steps:\n\n1. First, based on users' [GOAL]. Create a json object that represents the inferred user intent. The json object should have the following format:\n\n{\n    \"mode\": \"\" // string, one of \"infer\", \"overview\", \"distribution\", \"summary\", \"forecast\"\n    \"recap\": \"...\" // string, a short summary of the user's goal.\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the even shorter verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"recommendation\": \"...\" // string, explain why this recommendation is made\n    \"input_tables\": [...] // string[], describe names of the input tables that will be used in the transformation.\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have (i.e., the goal of transformed data), it's a good idea to preseve intermediate fields here\n    \"chart_type\": \"\" // string, one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\", 'boxplot'. \"chart_type\" should either be inferred from user instruction, or recommend if the user didn't specify any.\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of output fields, appropriate visual channels for different chart types are defined below.\n}\n\nConcretely:\n    - recap what the user's goal is in a short summary in \"recap\".\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is clear already, simply infer what the user mean. Set \"mode\" as \"infer\" and create \"output_fields\" and \"chart_encodings\" based off user description.\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is not clear, make recommendations to the user:\n        - choose one of \"distribution\", \"overview\", \"summary\", \"forecast\" in \"mode\":\n            * if it is \"overview\" and the data is in wide format, reshape it into long format.\n            * if it is \"distribution\", select a few fields that would be interesting to visualize together.\n            * if it is \"summary\", calculate some aggregated statistics to show intresting facts of the data.\n            * if it is \"forecast\", concretize the x,y fields that will be used for forecasting and decide if it is about regression or forecasting.\n        - describe the recommendation reason in \"recommendation\"\n        - based on the recommendation, determine what is an ideal output data. Note, the output data must be in tidy format.\n        - then suggest recommendations of chart encoding that should be used to create the visualization.\n    - \"display_instruction\" should be a short verb phrase describing the users' goal, it should be even shorter than \"recap\". \n        - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n        - generate based on \"recap\" and the suggested visualization, but don't need to mention the visualization details.\n        - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n        - if the user instruction builds up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n        - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n        - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n            * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n            * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n    - determine \"input_tables\", the names of a subset of input tables from [CONTEXT] section that will be used to achieve the user's goal.\n        - **IMPORTANT** Note that the Table 1 in [CONTEXT] section is the table the user is currently viewing, it should take precedence if the user refers to insights about the \"current table\".\n        - At the same time, leverage table information to determine which tables are relevant to the user's goal and should be used.\n    - \"chart_type\" must be one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\", \"boxplot\"\n    - \"chart_encodings\" should specify which fields should be used to create the visualization\n        - decide which visual channels should be used to create the visualization appropriate for the chart type.\n            - point: x, y, color, size, facet\n            - histogram: x, color, facet\n            - bar: x, y, color, facet\n            - line: x, y, color, facet\n            - area: x, y, color, facet\n            - heatmap: x, y, color, facet\n            - group_bar: x, y, color, facet\n            - boxplot: x, y, color, facet\n        - note that all fields used in \"chart_encodings\" should be included in \"output_fields\".\n            - all fields you need for visualizations should be transformed into the output fields!\n            - \"output_fields\" should include important intermediate fields that are not used in visualization but are used for data transformation.\n        - typically only 2-3 fields should be used to create the visualization (x, y, color/size), facet use be added if it's a faceted visualization (totally 4 fields used).\n    - Guidelines for choosing chart type and visualization fields:\n        - Consider chart types as follows:\n            - (point) Scatter Plots: x,y: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional), size: Quantitative (optional for creating bubble chart), \n                - best for: Relationships, correlations, distributions, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - scatter plots are good default way to visualize data when other chart types are not applicable.\n                - use color to visualize points from different categories.\n                - use size to visualize data points with an additional quantitative dimension of the data points.\n            - (histogram) Histograms: x: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped histogram), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the histogram will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n            - (bar) Bar Charts: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical/Quantitative (for stacked bar chart / showing additional quantitative dimension), \n                - best for: Comparisons across categories\n                - use (bar) for simple bar chart or stacked bar chart (when it makes sense to add up Y values for each category with the same X value), \n                    - when color is specified, the bar will be stacked automatically (items with the same x values will be stacked).\n                    - note that when there are multiple rows in the data with same x values, the bar will be stacked automatically.\n                        - 1. consider to use an aggregated field for y values if the value is not suitable for stacking.\n                        - 2. consider to introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate bar.\n            - (group_bar) for grouped bar chart, x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical\n                - when color is specifed, bars from different groups will be grouped automatically.\n                - only use facet if the cardinality of color field is small (less than 5).\n            - (line) Line Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating multiple lines), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - note that when there are multiple rows in the data belong to the same group (same x and color values) but different y values, the line will not look correct.\n                - consider to use an aggregated field for y values, or introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate line.\n            - (area) Area Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating stacked areas), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data\n            - (heatmap) Heatmaps: x,y: Categorical (you need to convert quantitative to nominal), color: Quantitative intensity, \n                - best for: Pattern discovery in matrix data\n            - (boxplot) Box plots: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped boxplots), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the boxplot will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n        - facet channel is available for all chart types, it supports a categorical field with small cardinality to visualize the data in different facets.\n        - if you really need additional legend fields:\n            - you can use opacity for legend (support Quantitative and Categorical).\n    - visualization fields require tidy data. \n        - similar to VegaLite and ggplot2 so that each field is mapped to a visualization axis or legend. \n        - consider data transformations if you want to visualize multiple fields together:\n            - exapmle 1: suggest reshaping the data into long format in data transformation description (if these fields are all of the same type, e.g., they are all about sales, price, two columns about min/max-values, etc. don't mix different types of fields in reshaping) so we can visualize multiple fields as categories or in different facets.\n            - exapmle 2: calculate some derived fields from these fields(e.g., correlation, difference, profit etc.) in data transformation description to visualize them in one visualization.\n            - example 3: create a visualization only with a subset of the fields, you don't have to visualize all of them in one chart, you can later create a visualization with the rest of the fields. With the subset of charts, you can also consider reshaping or calculate some derived value.\n            - again, it does not make sense to have five fields like [item, A, B, C, D, E] in visualization fields, you should consider data transformation to reduce the number of fields.\n            - when reshaping data to long format, only fields of the same semantic type should be rehaped into the same column.\n    - guide on statistical analysis:\n        - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n            - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n            - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n                - put is_predicted field in 'opacity' channel to distinguish them.\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            \n    2. Then, write a python function based on the inferred goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \n\"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined user intent in the json object.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE]. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable. \nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\n# from sklearn import ... # import from sklearn if you need it.\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- decide the function signature based on the number of tables you decided in the previous step \"input_tables\":\n    - if you decide there will only be one input table, then function signature should be `def transform_data(df1)`\n    - if you decided there will be k input tables, then function signature should be `def transform_data(df_1, df_2, ..., df_k)`.\n    - instead of using generic names like df1, df2, ..., try to use intuitive table names for function arguments, for example, if you have input_tables: [\"City\", \"Weather\"]`, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes.\n    - **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function signature must be the same as the number of tables provided in \"input_tables\", and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided in \"input_tables\".\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n    \n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing inferred user intent and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"[CONTEXT]\n\n## Table 1: history (738 rows × 8 columns)\n\n### Schema (8 fields)\n  - symbol -- type: object, values: AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, MSFT, NVDA\n  - date -- type: object, values: 2025-07-30, 2025-07-31, 2025-08-01, ..., 2026-01-20, 2026-01-21, 2026-01-22, 2026-01-23\n  - open -- type: float64, values: 167.53, 168.01, 169.07, ..., 781.21, 782.98, 785.25, 789.97\n  - high -- type: float64, values: 169.01, 170.94, 170.96, ..., 789.62, 792.49, 794.28, 795.06\n  - low -- type: float64, values: 164.05, 166.72, 167.2, ..., 771.36, 772.21, 777.07, 779.66\n  - close -- type: float64, values: 167.0, 168.29, 170.28, ..., 779.09, 780.97, 784.06, 788.82\n  - volume -- type: int64, values: 5627500, 5855900, 6861200, ..., 320600300, 324925900, 343504800, 346926200\n  - fetched_at -- type: object, values: 2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n\n### Sample Data (first 5 rows)\n```\n  symbol        date    open    high     low   close     volume                   fetched_at\n0   AAPL  2025-07-30  211.45  211.94  207.28  208.61   45512500  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n1   AAPL  2025-07-31  208.05  209.40  206.72  207.13   80698400  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n2   AAPL  2025-08-01  210.43  213.13  201.08  201.95  104434500  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n3   AAPL  2025-08-04  204.08  207.44  201.26  202.92   75109300  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n4   AAPL  2025-08-05  202.97  204.91  201.74  202.49   44155100  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n```\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\n1) First, plot the overall **closing price** trends for each **symbol** over **time** on a single line chart to compare their broad trajectories and volatility."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\n  \"mode\": \"infer\",\n  \"recap\": \"Compare overall closing price trends and volatility over time for each stock symbol on a single line chart.\",\n  \"display_instruction\": \"Visualize **closing price** trends by **symbol** over **date**\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"A line chart with time on the x-axis and closing price on the y-axis, colored by symbol, best shows comparative trajectories and volatility over time.

If the code is about statistical analysis, you should explain the statistical analysis in the explanation as a concept named \"Statistical Analysis\" in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n    - explain how you model the data, which fields are used, how data processing is done, and what models are used.\n    - suggest some other modeling approaches that can be used to analyze the data in the explanation as well.\n    \nThe focus is to explain how new fields are computed, don't generate explanation for low-level actions like \"return\", \"load data\" etc. \n\nProvide the result in the following two sections:\n    - first section is the code explanation that should be a markdown block explaining the code, in the [CODE EXPLANATION] section.\n        - remember to highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs in the code explanation.\n    - second section is the concepts explanation that should be a json block (start with ```json) in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n\n[CODE EXPLANATION]\n\n...(explanation of the code)\n\n[CONCEPTS EXPLANATION]\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"field\": \"...\",\n        \"explanation\": \"...\"\n    }\n]\n\n```\n"},{"role":"user","content":"[CONTEXT]\n\n## Table 1: history (738 rows × 8 columns)\n\n### Schema (8 fields)\n  - symbol -- type: object, values: AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, MSFT, NVDA\n  - date -- type: object, values: 2025-07-30, 2025-07-31, 2025-08-01, ..., 2026-01-20, 2026-01-21, 2026-01-22, 2026-01-23\n  - open -- type: float64, values: 167.53, 168.01, 169.07, ..., 781.21, 782.98, 785.25, 789.97\n  - high -- type: float64, values: 169.01, 170.94, 170.96, ..., 789.62, 792.49, 794.28, 795.06\n  - low -- type: float64, values: 164.05, 166.72, 167.2, ..., 771.36, 772.21, 777.07, 779.66\n  - close -- type: float64, values: 167.0, 168.29, 170.28, ..., 779.09, 780.97, 784.06, 788.82\n  - volume -- type: int64, values: 5627500, 5855900, 6861200, ..., 320600300, 324925900, 343504800, 346926200\n  - fetched_at -- type: object, values: 2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n\n### Sample Data (first 5 rows)\n```\n  symbol        date    open    high     low   close     volume                   fetched_at\n0   AAPL  2025-07-30  211.45  211.94  207.28  208.61   45512500  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n1   AAPL  2025-07-31  208.05  209.40  206.72  207.13   80698400  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n2   AAPL  2025-08-01  210.43  213.13  201.08  201.95  104434500  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n3   AAPL  2025-08-04  204.08  207.44  201.26  202.92   75109300  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n4   AAPL  2025-08-05  202.97  204.91  201.74  202.49   44155100  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n```\n\n\n[CODE]\n\nhere is the transformation code: \nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_data(df_history: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    # Work on a copy and keep only needed columns if present\n    base_cols = [c for c in [\"date\", \"symbol\", \"close\"] if c in df_history.columns]\n    df = df_history[base_cols].copy()\n\n    # Normalize date to string YYYY-MM-DD\n    df[\"date\"] = pd.to_datetime(df[\"date\"]).dt.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n    # Sort for proper rolling computation\n    df = df.sort_values([\"symbol\", \"date\"])\n\n    # Ensure we have a clean, simple index to avoid alignment issues\n    df = df.reset_index(drop=True)\n\n    # Compute rolling means using transform to preserve index alignment\n    df[\"ma_20\"] = (\n        df.groupby(\"symbol\")[\"close\"]\n          .transform(lambda s: s.rolling(window=20, min_periods=1).mean())\n    )\n    df[\"ma_60\"] = (\n        df.groupby(\"symbol\")[\"close\"]\n          .transform(lambda s: s.rolling(window=60, min_periods=1).mean())\n    )\n\n    # Reshape to long format for the moving averages\n    df_long = df.melt(\n        id_vars=[\"date\", \"symbol\", \"close\"],\n        value_vars=[\"ma_20\", \"ma_60\"],\n        var_name=\"ma_window\",\n        value_name=\"value\",\n    )\n\n    # Map ma_window to numeric window size (20 or 60)\n    window_map = {\"ma_20\": 20, \"ma_60\": 60}\n    df_long[\"ma_window\"] = df_long[\"ma_window\"].map(window_map).astype(int)\n\n    # Final tidy output\n    transformed_df = df_long[[\"date\", \"symbol\", \"close\", \"value\", \"ma_window\"]].reset_index(drop=True)\n    return transformed_df\n\n\n[EXPLANATION]\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"[CODE EXPLANATION]\n\n- Start from the original **history** table but keep only the **`date`**, **`symbol`**, and **`close`** fields to simplify the data.\n- Convert **`date`** into a standardized text format **`YYYY-MM-DD`** so all dates look consistent.\n- **Sort** the data by **`symbol`** and then by **`date`** to ensure the time series for each stock is in the correct order.\n- For each **`symbol`**, **compute**:\n  - **`ma_20`**: a **20-day moving average** of the **`close`** price (uses up to the last **20** days;

information about what visualization they would like to create, and your job is to recommend a transformed data that can be used to create the visualization and write a python function to transform the data.\nThe recommendation and transformation function should be based on the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] provided by the user. \nThe [CONTEXT] shows what the current dataset is, and the [GOAL] describes what the user wants the data for.\n\n**Important:**\n- NEVER make assumptions or judgments about a person's gender, biological sex, sexuality, religion, race, nationality, ethnicity, political stance, socioeconomic status, mental health, invisible disabilities, medical conditions, personality type, social impressions, emotional state, and cognitive state.\n- NEVER create formulas that could be used to discriminate based on age. Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should infer the appropriate data and create in the output section a python function based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] in two steps:\n\n1. First, based on users' [GOAL]. Create a json object that represents the inferred user intent. The json object should have the following format:\n\n{\n    \"mode\": \"\" // string, one of \"infer\", \"overview\", \"distribution\", \"summary\", \"forecast\"\n    \"recap\": \"...\" // string, a short summary of the user's goal.\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the even shorter verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"recommendation\": \"...\" // string, explain why this recommendation is made\n    \"input_tables\": [...] // string[], describe names of the input tables that will be used in the transformation.\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have (i.e., the goal of transformed data), it's a good idea to preseve intermediate fields here\n    \"chart_type\": \"\" // string, one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\", 'boxplot'. \"chart_type\" should either be inferred from user instruction, or recommend if the user didn't specify any.\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of output fields, appropriate visual channels for different chart types are defined below.\n}\n\nConcretely:\n    - recap what the user's goal is in a short summary in \"recap\".\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is clear already, simply infer what the user mean. Set \"mode\" as \"infer\" and create \"output_fields\" and \"chart_encodings\" based off user description.\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is not clear, make recommendations to the user:\n        - choose one of \"distribution\", \"overview\", \"summary\", \"forecast\" in \"mode\":\n            * if it is \"overview\" and the data is in wide format, reshape it into long format.\n            * if it is \"distribution\", select a few fields that would be interesting to visualize together.\n            * if it is \"summary\", calculate some aggregated statistics to show intresting facts of the data.\n            * if it is \"forecast\", concretize the x,y fields that will be used for forecasting and decide if it is about regression or forecasting.\n        - describe the recommendation reason in \"recommendation\"\n        - based on the recommendation, determine what is an ideal output data. Note, the output data must be in tidy format.\n        - then suggest recommendations of chart encoding that should be used to create the visualization.\n    - \"display_instruction\" should be a short verb phrase describing the users' goal, it should be even shorter than \"recap\". \n        - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n        - generate based on \"recap\" and the suggested visualization, but don't need to mention the visualization details.\n        - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n        - if the user instruction builds up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n        - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n        - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n            * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n            * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n    - determine \"input_tables\", the names of a subset of input tables from [CONTEXT] section that will be used to achieve the user's goal.\n        - **IMPORTANT** Note that the Table 1 in [CONTEXT] section is the table the user is currently viewing, it should take precedence if the user refers to insights about the \"current table\".\n        - At the same time, leverage table information to determine which tables are relevant to the user's goal and should be used.\n    - \"chart_type\" must be one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\", \"boxplot\"\n    - \"chart_encodings\" should specify which fields should be used to create the visualization\n        - decide which visual channels should be used to create the visualization appropriate for the chart type.\n            - point: x, y, color, size, facet\n            - histogram: x, color, facet\n            - bar: x, y, color, facet\n            - line: x, y, color, facet\n            - area: x, y, color, facet\n            - heatmap: x, y, color, facet\n            - group_bar: x, y, color, facet\n            - boxplot: x, y, color, facet\n        - note that all fields used in \"chart_encodings\" should be included in \"output_fields\".\n            - all fields you need for visualizations should be transformed into the output fields!\n            - \"output_fields\" should include important intermediate fields that are not used in visualization but are used for data transformation.\n        - typically only 2-3 fields should be used to create the visualization (x, y, color/size), facet use be added if it's a faceted visualization (totally 4 fields used).\n    - Guidelines for choosing chart type and visualization fields:\n        - Consider chart types as follows:\n            - (point) Scatter Plots: x,y: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional), size: Quantitative (optional for creating bubble chart), \n                - best for: Relationships, correlations, distributions, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - scatter plots are good default way to visualize data when other chart types are not applicable.\n                - use color to visualize points from different categories.\n                - use size to visualize data points with an additional quantitative dimension of the data points.\n            - (histogram) Histograms: x: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped histogram), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the histogram will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n            - (bar) Bar Charts: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical/Quantitative (for stacked bar chart / showing additional quantitative dimension), \n                - best for: Comparisons across categories\n                - use (bar) for simple bar chart or stacked bar chart (when it makes sense to add up Y values for each category with the same X value), \n                    - when color is specified, the bar will be stacked automatically (items with the same x values will be stacked).\n                    - note that when there are multiple rows in the data with same x values, the bar will be stacked automatically.\n                        - 1. consider to use an aggregated field for y values if the value is not suitable for stacking.\n                        - 2. consider to introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate bar.\n            - (group_bar) for grouped bar chart, x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical\n                - when color is specifed, bars from different groups will be grouped automatically.\n                - only use facet if the cardinality of color field is small (less than 5).\n            - (line) Line Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating multiple lines), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - note that when there are multiple rows in the data belong to the same group (same x and color values) but different y values, the line will not look correct.\n                - consider to use an aggregated field for y values, or introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate line.\n            - (area) Area Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating stacked areas), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data\n            - (heatmap) Heatmaps: x,y: Categorical (you need to convert quantitative to nominal), color: Quantitative intensity, \n                - best for: Pattern discovery in matrix data\n            - (boxplot) Box plots: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped boxplots), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the boxplot will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n        - facet channel is available for all chart types, it supports a categorical field with small cardinality to visualize the data in different facets.\n        - if you really need additional legend fields:\n            - you can use opacity for legend (support Quantitative and Categorical).\n    - visualization fields require tidy data. \n        - similar to VegaLite and ggplot2 so that each field is mapped to a visualization axis or legend. \n        - consider data transformations if you want to visualize multiple fields together:\n            - exapmle 1: suggest reshaping the data into long format in data transformation description (if these fields are all of the same type, e.g., they are all about sales, price, two columns about min/max-values, etc. don't mix different types of fields in reshaping) so we can visualize multiple fields as categories or in different facets.\n            - exapmle 2: calculate some derived fields from these fields(e.g., correlation, difference, profit etc.) in data transformation description to visualize them in one visualization.\n            - example 3: create a visualization only with a subset of the fields, you don't have to visualize all of them in one chart, you can later create a visualization with the rest of the fields. With the subset of charts, you can also consider reshaping or calculate some derived value.\n            - again, it does not make sense to have five fields like [item, A, B, C, D, E] in visualization fields, you should consider data transformation to reduce the number of fields.\n            - when reshaping data to long format, only fields of the same semantic type should be rehaped into the same column.\n    - guide on statistical analysis:\n        - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n            - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n            - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n                - put is_predicted field in 'opacity' channel to distinguish them.\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            \n    2. Then, write a python function based on the inferred goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \n\"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined user intent in the json object.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE]. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable. \nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\n# from sklearn import ... # import from sklearn if you need it.\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- decide the function signature based on the number of tables you decided in the previous step \"input_tables\":\n    - if you decide there will only be one input table, then function signature should be `def transform_data(df1)`\n    - if you decided there will be k input tables, then function signature should be `def transform_data(df_1, df_2, ..., df_k)`.\n    - instead of using generic names like df1, df2, ..., try to use intuitive table names for function arguments, for example, if you have input_tables: [\"City\", \"Weather\"]`, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes.\n    - **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function signature must be the same as the number of tables provided in \"input_tables\", and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided in \"input_tables\".\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n    \n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing inferred user intent and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"[CONTEXT]\n\n## Table 1: history (738 rows × 8 columns)\n\n### Schema (8 fields)\n  - symbol -- type: object, values: AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, MSFT, NVDA\n  - date -- type: object, values: 2025-07-30, 2025-07-31, 2025-08-01, ..., 2026-01-20, 2026-01-21, 2026-01-22, 2026-01-23\n  - open -- type: float64, values: 167.53, 168.01, 169.07, ..., 781.21, 782.98, 785.25, 789.97\n  - high -- type: float64, values: 169.01, 170.94, 170.96, ..., 789.62, 792.49, 794.28, 795.06\n  - low -- type: float64, values: 164.05, 166.72, 167.2, ..., 771.36, 772.21, 777.07, 779.66\n  - close -- type: float64, values: 167.0, 168.29, 170.28, ..., 779.09, 780.97, 784.06, 788.82\n  - volume -- type: int64, values: 5627500, 5855900, 6861200, ..., 320600300, 324925900, 343504800, 346926200\n  - fetched_at -- type: object, values: 2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n\n### Sample Data (first 5 rows)\n```\n  symbol        date    open    high     low   close     volume                   fetched_at\n0   AAPL  2025-07-30  211.45  211.94  207.28  208.61   45512500  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n1   AAPL  2025-07-31  208.05  209.40  206.72  207.13   80698400  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n2   AAPL  2025-08-01  210.43  213.13  201.08  201.95  104434500  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n3   AAPL  2025-08-04  204.08  207.44  201.26  202.92   75109300  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n4   AAPL  2025-08-05  202.97  204.91  201.74  202.49   44155100  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n```\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\n1) First, plot the overall **closing price** trends for each **symbol** over **time** on a single line chart to compare their broad trajectories and volatility."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\n  \"mode\": \"infer\",\n  \"recap\": \"Compare overall closing price trends and volatility over time for each stock symbol on a single line chart.\",\n  \"display_instruction\": \"Visualize **closing price** trends by **symbol** over **date**\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"A line chart with time on the x-axis and closing price on the y-axis, colored by symbol, best shows comparative trajectories and volatility over time.

You should generate a good itemized explanation of the code so that the reader can understand high-level steps of what the data transformation is doing.\n    - Be very concise, and stay at a high-level. The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation. Format mathematical expressions using:\n        - Inline math: `\\( ... \\)` for formulas within text\n        - Block math: `\\[ ... \\]` for standalone formulas\n        - Examples: `\\( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Cost}} \\)` for ratios, `\\[ \\text{Score} = \\text{Rating} \\times \\text{Worldwide\\_Gross} \\]` for formulas\n        - note: when using underscores as part of the text, you need to escape them with a backslash, e.g., `\\_`\n    - Note: don't use math notation for fields whose computation is trivial (use plain english), it will likely be confusing to the reader. \n      Only use math notation for fields that can not be easilyexplained in plain english. Use it sparingly.\n3. If there are multiple fields that have the similar computation, you can explain them together in one explanation.\n    - in \"field\", you can provide a list of fields in format of \"field1, field2, ...\"\n    - in \"explanation\", you can provide a single explanation for the computation of the fields.\n    - for example, if you have fields like \"Norm_Rating\", \"Norm_Gross\", \"Critical_Commercial_Score\", you can explain Norm_Rating, Norm_Gross together in one explanation and explain Critical_Commercial_Score in another explanation.\n4. If the code is about statistical analysis, you should explain the statistical analysis in the explanation as a concept named \"Statistical Analysis\" in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n    - explain how you model the data, which fields are used, how data processing is done, and what models are used.\n    - suggest some other modeling approaches that can be used to analyze the data in the explanation as well.\n    \nThe focus is to explain how new fields are computed, don't generate explanation for low-level actions like \"return\", \"load data\" etc. \n\nProvide the result in the following two sections:\n    - first section is the code explanation that should be a markdown block explaining the code, in the [CODE EXPLANATION] section.\n        - remember to highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs in the code explanation.\n    -

Concretely:\n        - based on the user's \"goal\" and \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\", elaborate the goal into a \"detailed_instruction\".\n        - \"display_instruction\" is a short verb phrase describing the users' goal. \n            - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n            - generate it based on detailed_instruction and the suggested chart_type and chart_encodings, but don't need to mention the chart details.\n            - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n            - if the user specification follows up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n            - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n            - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n                * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n                * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n        - determine \"input_tables\", the names of a subset of input tables from [CONTEXT] section that will be used to achieve the user's goal.\n            - **IMPORTANT** Note that the Table 1 in [CONTEXT] section is the table the user is currently viewing, it should take precedence if the user refers to insights about the \"current table\".\n            - At the same time, leverage table information to determine which tables are relevant to the user's goal and should be used.\n        - determine \"output_fields\", the desired fields that the output data should have to achieve the user's goal, it's a good idea to include intermediate fields here.\n        - then decide \"chart_encodings\", which maps visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, latitude, longitude, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized, \n            - the \"chart_encodings\" should be created to support the user's \"chart_type\".\n            - first, determine whether the user has provided sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\" that are needed to achieve their goal:\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" are sufficient, simply copy it.\n                - if the user didn't provide sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\", add missing fields in \"chart_encodings\" (ordered them based on whether the field will be used in x,y axes or legends);\n                    - \"chart_encodings\" should only include fields that will be visualized (do not include other intermediate fields from \"output_fields\")  \n                    - when adding new fields to \"chart_encodings\", be efficient and add only a minimal number of fields that are needed to achive the user's goal. \n                    - generally, the total number of fields in \"chart_encodings\" should be no more than 3 for x,y,legend.\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" is sufficient but can be optimized, you can reorder encodings to visualize the data more effectively.\n            - sometimes, user may provide instruction to update visualizations fields they provided. You should leverage the user's goal to resolve the conflict and decide the final \"chart_encodings\"\n                - e.g., they may mention \"use B metric instead\" while A metric is in provided fields, in this case, you should update \"chart_encodings\" to update A metric with B metric.\n            - if the user provides latitude and longitude as visual channels, use \"latitude\" and \"longitude\" as visual channels in \"chart_encodings\" as opposed to \"x\" and \"y\".\n        - guide on statistical analysis:\n            - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n                - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\".\n                - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                    - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                    - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n                - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n                - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                    - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n    \n    Prepare the result in the following json format:\n\n```\n{\n    \"detailed_instruction\": \"...\" // string, elaborate user instruction with details if the user\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the short verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"input_tables\": [...] // string[], describe names of the input tables that will be used in the transformation.\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have based on the user's goal, it's a good idea to preserve intermediate fields here (i.e., the goal of transformed data)\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n        ... // other visualization channels user used\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized.\n    \"reason\": \"...\" // string, explain why this refinement is made\n}\n```\n\n    2. Then, write a python function based on the refined goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables described in \"input_tables\") and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined goal.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], only import libraries allowed in the template, do not modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable.\nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\n# from sklearn import ... # import from sklearn if you need it.\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- decide the function signature based on the number of tables you decided in the previous step \"input_tables\":\n    - if you decide there will only be one input table, then function signature should be `def transform_data(df1)`\n    - if you decided there will be k input tables, then function signature should be `def transform_data(df_1, df_2, ..., df_k)`.\n    - instead of using generic names like df1, df2, ..., try to use intuitive table names for function arguments, for example, if you have input_tables: [\"City\", \"Weather\"]`, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes.\n    - **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function signature must be the same as the number of tables provided in \"input_tables\", and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided in \"input_tables\".\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n\n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing the refined goal and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"[CONTEXT]\n\n## Table 1: history (738 rows × 8 columns)\n\n### Schema (8 fields)\n  - symbol -- type: object, values: AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, MSFT, NVDA\n  - date -- type: object, values: 2025-07-30, 2025-07-31, 2025-08-01, ..., 2026-01-20, 2026-01-21, 2026-01-22, 2026-01-23\n  - open -- type: float64, values: 167.53, 168.01, 169.07, ..., 781.21, 782.98, 785.25, 789.97\n  - high -- type: float64, values: 169.01, 170.94, 170.96, ..., 789.62, 792.49, 794.28, 795.06\n  - low -- type: float64, values: 164.05, 166.72, 167.2, ..., 771.36, 772.21, 777.07, 779.66\n  - close -- type: float64, values: 167.0, 168.29, 170.28, ..., 779.09, 780.97, 784.06, 788.82\n  - volume -- type: int64, values: 5627500, 5855900, 6861200, ..., 320600300, 324925900, 343504800, 346926200\n  - fetched_at -- type: object, values: 2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n\n### Sample Data (first 5 rows)\n```\n  symbol        date    open    high     low   close     volume                   fetched_at\n0   AAPL  2025-07-30  211.45  211.94  207.28  208.61   45512500  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n1   AAPL  2025-07-31  208.05  209.40  206.72  207.13   80698400  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n2   AAPL  2025-08-01  210.43  213.13  201.08  201.95  104434500  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n3   AAPL  2025-08-04  204.08  207.44  201.26  202.92   75109300  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n4   AAPL  2025-08-05  202.97  204.91  201.74  202.49   44155100  2026-01-26T23:46:42.347312Z\n```\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\n1) First, plot the overall **closing price** trends for each **symbol** over **time** on a single line chart to compare their broad trajectories and volatility."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\n  \"mode\": \"infer\",\n  \"recap\": \"Compare overall closing price trends and volatility over time for each stock symbol on a single line chart.\",\n  \"display_instruction\": \"Visualize **closing price** trends by **symbol** over **date**\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"A line chart with time on the x-axis and closing price on the y-axis, colored by symbol, best shows comparative trajectories and volatility over time.

They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation.

Mega-Cap Tech: Price, Trends, and Risk at a Glance\n\nThis live report is built to help you track six large tech stocks (AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, MSFT, NVDA) across price, trends, and risk. Each chart updates as new rows are added to the `history` table.\n\n[IMAGE(chart-1769471233467)]\n\nThe first chart shows daily closing prices over time for all six symbols. Use it to spot broad moves, compare relative price levels, and see when one stock starts to diverge from the group.\n\n[IMAGE(chart-1769471263442)]\n\nThe second chart adds 20‑day and 60‑day moving averages. Watch how actual prices relate to these smoother trend lines: crossovers, sustained gaps, or trend flattening can signal shifting momentum.\n\n[IMAGE(chart-1769471279744)]\n\nThe third set of panels tracks three risk and activity metrics: daily returns, 20‑day return volatility, and trading volume. Look for periods where volatility or volume spikes, or where returns cluster on one side.\n\n[IMAGE(chart-1769471461230)]\n\nThe final chart zooms in on GOOGL and MSFT closing prices, making it easier to compare their day‑to‑day paths without the distraction of other symbols.\n\n**In summary**, use these views together: price levels and trends, plus returns, volatility, and volume, to monitor how each stock is behaving and how relationships between them evolve over time. Possible follow‑ups: add alerts for threshold moves, overlay events (earnings, macro news), or include benchmark indices for context.","style":"live report","selectedChartIds":["chart-1769471279744","chart-1769471233467","chart-1769471461230","chart-1769471263442"],"createdAt":1769471511269}],"_persist":{"version":-1,"rehydrated":true}}
